# Authentication & Navigation System

## 🚀 **Comprehensive Authentication & Navigation Fixes**

### **✅ Key Improvements Made:**

1. **Route Protection System**

   - Created `RouteGuard` component with flexible authentication requirements
   - `requireAuth` - Requires user login
   - `requireAdmin` - Requires admin role
   - `allowUnauthenticated` - For login pages (redirects authenticated users)

2. **Unified Navigation Component**

   - Smart navigation that adapts based on authentication state
   - Shows appropriate links for authenticated/unauthenticated users
   - Displays user information and sign-out option
   - Admin links only visible to admin users

3. **Enhanced Session Management**

   - Proper loading states during authentication checks
   - Automatic redirects based on user roles
   - Session persistence and cleanup
   - Error handling for authentication failures

4. **Route-Specific Protection**
   - **Public routes**: `/`, `/catalog` - Accessible to everyone
   - **Login routes**: `/login`, `/admin/login` - Redirect authenticated users
   - **Protected routes**: `/dashboard`, `/questionnaires` - Require authentication
   - **Admin routes**: `/admin/*` - Require admin role

### **🔧 Components Updated:**

- ✅ `middleware.ts` - Basic route filtering
- ✅ `RouteGuard.tsx` - Authentication protection wrapper
- ✅ `Navigation.tsx` - Smart navigation bar
- ✅ `page.tsx` (Home) - Updated with new navigation
- ✅ `catalog/page.tsx` - Public catalog with navigation
- ✅ `login/page.tsx` - Protected from authenticated users
- ✅ `admin/login/page.tsx` - Admin login with proper guards
- ✅ `dashboard/page.tsx` - Requires user authentication
- ✅ `admin/page.tsx` - Requires admin authentication
- ✅ `questionnaires/page.tsx` - Requires user authentication
- ✅ `layout.tsx` - Simplified layout wrapper

### **🔐 Authentication Flow:**

1. **Unauthenticated User:**

   - Can access home page and catalog
   - Redirected to login when accessing protected routes
   - Can access login pages

2. **Regular User (authenticated):**

   - Can access dashboard, questionnaires, catalog
   - Cannot access admin routes (redirected to dashboard)
   - Cannot access login pages (redirected to dashboard)

3. **Admin User:**
   - Can access all routes including admin panel
   - Cannot access login pages (redirected to admin panel)
   - Has admin navigation options

### **🐛 Bugs Fixed:**

- ❌ **Navigation inconsistency** - Now unified across all pages
- ❌ **Missing route protection** - All sensitive routes now protected
- ❌ **Poor session handling** - Enhanced with loading states and proper redirects
- ❌ **Admin access control** - Proper role-based routing
- ❌ **Login page accessibility** - Proper guards for authenticated users
- ❌ **Loading states** - Consistent loading indicators during auth checks
